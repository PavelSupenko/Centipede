Dear player.
That is a centipede game - a remake of the game of 1980 from Atari.
You control the spaceship that is into the asteroid belt.
You are being hunted by a huge cosmic monster that you need to destroy.

Rules:
1. You control a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen. If you are playing on a computer, use the arrow or the WASD keys.
2. Shots are made by mouse clicks or tap on the screen.
2. The game field is filled with asteroids in random order.
3. To destroy an asteroid you need to hit it 3 times.
4. A centipede moves from screen top according to the following rules:
	1. It moves horizontally in one of the directions.
	2. If it sees an obstacle, it moves to a lower level and changes direction.
	3. To destroy the cell centipedes you need to hit once.
	3. The destruction of the head creates an asteroid on this position and the next cell becomes the head.
	4. The destruction of the cell in the middle of the body creates an asteroid and divides the centipede into two parts, which move independently.
5. For the destruction of the middle cell you get 100 points.
6. For the destruction of the head you get 300 points.
7. Also, enemy ships appear periodically, which leave behind new obstacles.
